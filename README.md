# CS312 Fermat

### Project 1 for CS312

This code includes:
<ul>
        <li>Fermat primality test algorithm</li>
</ul>

Code up the Fermat primality test pseudocode from Figure 1.8 of the text. You may set k to any value you like (see p. 27), this value indicates how many random trials (values of a) are used.

Implement modular exponentiation (pseudo-code in Figure 1.4 on p. 19). Your primality test should use your modular exponentiation function and should work properly for numbers as large as 230 = 1073741824.

Code the probability that k Fermat trials gave you the correct answer -- see the discussion between Figure 1.7 and Figure 1.8.

Implement the Miller-Rabin primality test. There is no pseudo-code in the book for this, but you can find what you need in the sidebar on p. 28 and in the discussion that follows.

Code the probability that k Miller-Rabin trials gave you the correct answer -- see the note in the sidebar on p. 28 and the discussion below.
